Jake is a PhD student in the Department of Collective Behaviour at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behaviour working with Prof. Iain Couzin. Jake studies how biological systems acquire and process information for making decisions. His research on insects, fish, and ungulates tests key assumptions of animal behavior at multiple scales by integrating computer vision, machine learning, information theory, and Bayesian inference. He is particularly interested in how animal collectives coordinate their movement and how individual behavior contributes to the dynamics of group-level behavior.
