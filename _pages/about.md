Jake is a Research Fellow at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/) working with [Martin Wikelski](https://www.ab.mpg.de/wikelski), [Iain Couzin](https://www.ab.mpg.de/couzin), and [Meg Crofoot](https://www.ab.mpg.de/crofoot).

Jake studies how biological systems acquire and process information for making decisions. His research on insects, fish, and ungulates tests key assumptions of animal behavior at multiple scales by integrating computer vision, machine learning, information theory, and Bayesian inference. He is particularly interested in how animal collectives coordinate their movement and how individual behavior contributes to the dynamics of group-level behavior.
